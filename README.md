## Diarization with Transcription

The transcription output is not yet integrated with RescueBox. To see the diarized audio transcription we can run the model.py file. The output will be displayed in the terminal!

First make sure ffmpeg is installed on your system, if you don't already have it

for MacOS follow the below steps

if you already have homebrew you can use the below command. If not you can follow the (documentation)[https://docs.brew.sh/Installation].
